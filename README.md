# Vimspector-templates

Create template configurations for Vimspector

## Description

This is a small plugin that is supposed to help with the creation of ``.vimspector.json`` configuration files. 
It is a set of templates from the Vimspector documentation including some comments, that make it easier to 
get started. Of course, those templates will not cover all use cases and will not be sufficient for complex projects,
but they can surely save some time when debugging small applications.

## Usage
```vim
:VimspectorCreateConfig <TAB>
```
